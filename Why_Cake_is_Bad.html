  <h1>Why Cake is Bad</h1>
<p>Cake is a dangerous substance in which people can get seriously sick. I once ate cake batter and I got sick! To prove that it is bad, many people have run experiments on cake effects on the human body.</p>
<h2>Experiment results</h2>
<p>On one of these experiments they give a slice of store-bought chocolate cake. Thye will then see what happens in the hour after consumption. It takes the boy 30 seconds to finish the slice, then he sits down in his chair bored shortly after. Within 5 minutes after eating the cake, he starts running around and blowing things up. Following those results, he starts hacking into the government, and robs 27 banks within the span of 10 minutes. He then runs for president, and using his mind control powers, he gets every person on Earth to vote for him. He continues his reign for global domination. He eventually conquers every place on earth and creates laws that make him rich. He did all of this within an hour of consuming the cake. However, his time eventually comes to an end. He dies of cake exactly 90 minutes after eating it. He exploded, leaving the whole world in an political and economic mess.</p>
