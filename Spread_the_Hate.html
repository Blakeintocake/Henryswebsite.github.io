  <h2>Why Spread the Hate?</h2>
  <p>
    The only way to stop the evil cake that has plagued everybody's lives is to just say no! If everybody hates cake, then nobody will make that foolish dish. Cake has actually killed people before! They were allergic to the eggs and stuff in it! So please save lives by spreading the hate.

  <h2>How to Spread the Hate?</h2>
  <p>
    The only way to spread the hate is to make people see your opinions. Post bad things about cake on social media, share this website, and even tell people in person. Bonus points if you threaten them! Make sure people do not eat cake AT ANY COST. Please resort to physical violence if necissary.
